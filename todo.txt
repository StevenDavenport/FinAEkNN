TODO:


- ~~Add a KNN model to the pipeline~~
    - How do I feed the data to KNN now? 
		- Perhaps impliment a game loop that feeds the data to the KNN model?
		    - Similar to NinjaTrader's OnBarUpdate() method
				- Could put game loop in a seperate file, backtest.py for example
		hmm 0.0

- GIT

- Try bigger network, train on more data

- Bigger dataset?

- EVENTUALLY:::
- Maybe try 2 KNNs, one for directional bias, one for movement bias.
- Try and train the KNN and AE at the same time, probably with RL. 
    - With either 1 or 2 KNNs
- Maybe feed KNN output to another model?
		- What other model could use the KNN output?
